        <h2> My College Experience </h2>

        <p> College was such a big shift from high school for me when I first started.<br> 
            Now I can say I am more adjusted and comfortable to the college life <br> 
            but with every new semester comes with new challenges which I am<br>
            looking forward to take on. </p>
        
        <p> I have had experience with learning coding in the past however I was<br>
            never really good at it. Fingers cross, I will get the hang of it this time! </p>

        <p>As Emily Dickinson once said <blockquote><i>â€œOne step at a time is all it takes to get you there"</i></blockquote></p>
